# PySTA

PySTA is   Simple Torrent-like Application (STA) with the protocols defined by each group, using
the TCP/IP protocol stack and must support multi-direction data transfering (MDDT).

## Features

- The application includes the two types of hosts: tracker and peer.
- A centralized tracker keeps track of multiple peers and stores what pieces of files.
- Through tracker protocol, a peer informs the server as to what files are contained in its local
repository but does not actually transmit file data to the server.
- When a peer requires a file that does not belong to its repository, a request is sent to the
tracker.
- MDDT: The client can download multiple files from multiple source peer at once,
simultaneously.

pip install bencodepy logging requests
